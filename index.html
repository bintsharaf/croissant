   <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
   <p>Croissant, French pastry that is typically crescent-shaped, which is the origin of its French name.

Although there are earlier culinary references to “croissants,” the first recipe for the croissant as it is known today emerged only as recently as 1906. The huge growth in popularity of the croissant appears to have been a 20th-century sensation.</p>
